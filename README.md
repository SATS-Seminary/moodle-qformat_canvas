#Canvas XML question import format

This Moodle question import format can import questions exported from the Canvas LMS as an XML file into Moodle.

It was created by Jean-Michel Vedrine.
##Installation
To install, either download the zip file, unzip it, and place it in the directory moodle\question\format. (You will need to rename the directory from "moodle-qformat_fronter" to just "fronter".)

Alternatively, get the code using git by running the following command in the top level folder of your Moodle install:

git clone git://github.com/jmvedrine/moodle-qformat_fronter.git question/format/fronter

You must visit Site administration and install it like any other Moodle plugin.

It will then add a new choice when you import questions in the question bank.
